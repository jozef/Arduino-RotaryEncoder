NAME

    RotaryEncoder_single.ino - print rotary encoder data on serial port and
    brighten/dimm led.

DESCRIPTION

    When turning the rotary encoder clock wise will add-up to the counter
    and increase the brightness of the led. Once maximum value is reached
    the led will start blinking. On counterclockwise will decrease the
    counter and once below zero will start to blink. Pushing the button
    will light-up the led to maximum intensity. And print out counter
    status to the serial port.
