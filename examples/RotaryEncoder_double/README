NAME

    RotaryEncoder_double.ino - two rotary encoders brighten/dimm 2 leds

DESCRIPTION

    When turning the rotary encoder clock wise will add-up to the counter
    and increase the brightness of the led. Pushing the button will
    light-up the led to maximum intensity and print out counter status to
    the serial port.

    rotary encoder 1:

        pin 2 → A pin
        pin 4 → B pin
        pin 7 → Button pin
        pin 10 → led + resistor

    rotary encoder 2:

        pin 3 → A pin
        pin 5 → B pin
        pin 8 → Button pin
        pin 11 → led + resistor
