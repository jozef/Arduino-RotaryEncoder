SYNOPSIS

        #include <Arduino.h>
        #include <RotaryEncoder.h>      // https://github.com/jozef/Arduino-RotaryEncoder

        }
    
        void loop () {
            if (rote.btn_pressed()) {
                // switch is pressed
                Serial.println("switch pressed");
                rote.counter = 0;
            }
            if (rote.changed()) {
                Serial.println(rote.counter);
                if (rote.counter > 0) {
                    // more steps CW then CCW
                }

DESCRIPTION

    Arduino class/library to read-out one or more rotary encoders.

    See examples/ folder for schematics and example usage.

 PROPERTIES

    int counter:

    number of rotation steps

    int8_t direction:

    -1 for counter clockwise, 0 for one step reversed to the previous
    direction or 1 for clockwise turning.

    int limit_min; int limit_max:

    minimum and maximum value that counter can have. if both are the same
    value, no limit.

    int step:

    how much is a single rotational step. by default 1.

    uint8_t pin_a:

    Arduino pin on which encoder pin A is connected. If the pin supports
    interrupt, update() function is called automatically.

    uint8_t pin_b:

    Arduino pin on which encoder pin B is connected.

    uint8_t pin_btn:

    Arduino pin on which encoder push button is connected.

 METHODS

    RotaryEncoder(uint8_t a, uint8_t b, uint8_t btn = 0, int init_counter =
    0):

    Constructor, a and b pins are required. Button pin and initial value
    for counter optional.

    void setup():

    Will initiate pins and interrupts.

    bool update():

    Needs to be called as "fast as possible" if Arduino pin connected to
    encoder pin A is not on an interrupt pin to update state and do the
    counting.

    bool changed():

    Set to true if there was any change to the counter since the last call
    of this function.

    bool btn_pressed():

    Returns true/false if button is pressed.

EXAMPLES

 examples/RotaryEncoder_single/RotaryEncoder_synopsis.ino

    Code from SYNOPSIS section.

 examples/RotaryEncoder_single/RotaryEncoder_single.ino

    Print rotary counted value on serial port and light up led.
    Brighten/Dimm led based on rotary counter.
